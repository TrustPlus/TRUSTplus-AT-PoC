TRUSTplus-AT-PoC is the Automatic Transactions Privacy Proof of Concept being tested outside of the TRUSTplus QT wallet prior to inclusion in the wallet.
Initial testing will be conducted via interfacing with TrustPlusd to construct default transaction types and subsequent raw transactions. 
Once the PoC phase is complete the code will be ported to the next version of the TRUSTplus wallet. 

Please contact Sergio Tafur <setafur@gmail.com> with any questions/concerns and/or interest in collaboration.
